# Booths Division Algorithm

This program implements Booth's algorithm to perform division of two numbers. The algorithm is used to perform multiplication or division of binary numbers.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.10.2 or above
- Binary.py module (included)

## How to use
Run the program.
- Enter the number of bits for the registers.
- Enter the dividend and divisor values in the corresponding binary or 2's complement form.
- The program will output the intermediate steps for each cycle and the final quotient and remainder.

## Inputs
The program accepts the following inputs:

- no_bits: Number of bits for the registers.
- dividend: Dividend value in binary or 2's complement form.
- divisor: Divisor value in binary or 2's complement form.

## Outputs
The program outputs the following:
- Intermediate steps for each cycle.
- Final quotient and remainder.

## Credits
This program was developed by Valerian Coelho. It uses the Binary Library, which were developed by the same author.
